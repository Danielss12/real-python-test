FLASK	

What’s going on here?
Let’s first look at the code without the function:
1
from flask import Flask
2
3
app = Flask(__name__)
4
5
6
if __name__ == "__main__":
app.run()
1. First, we imported the Flask class from the flask library in order to create our web
application.
2. Next, we created an instance of the Flask class and assigned it to the variable app .
3. Finally, we used the run() method to run the app locally. By setting the __name__
variable equal to "__main__" , we indicated that we’re running the statements in the
current file (as a module) rather than importing it. Does this make sense? If not, check
out this link. You can read more about modules from the Python official documenta-
tion.

--------------------

1. Here we applied two decorators - @app.route("/") and @app.route("/hello")
to the hello_world() function. These decorators are used to define routes. In other
words, we created two routes - / and /hello - which are bound to our main url,
http://127.0.0.1:5000. Thus, we are able to access the function by navigating to either
http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello.
2. The function simply returned the string “Hello, World!”.
